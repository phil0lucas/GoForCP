Set all code to R/O and checkpoint in Git

Check for consistency

Run go fmt on everything

Test routines : e.g. check the reads / writes mirror each other.

Examine outputs for consistency / sense / presentation level etc.

Comment well and consistently

REview code. Any hard-codes to remove? Any redundant code to remove. Anything repeated that can be parameterized or removed by using interfaces?

Want to same thing with Sex and Race? Write a func that writes a func for each case!

Try to incorporate an example of an interface.
