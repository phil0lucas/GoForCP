Check for consistency

Run go fmt on everything

Test routines

Examine outputs for consistency / sense / presentation level etc.

Comment well and consistently

REview code. Any hard-codes to remove? Any redundant code to remove. Anything repeated that can be parameterized or removed by using interfaces?
