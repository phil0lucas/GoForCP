# GoForCP
Implementation of simple Clinical Programming outputs in Go

Traditionally, Clinical (sometimes callsed Statistical) Programming departments use SAS
for Data Management, Summary and Reporting. This is the final leg in a set of 3 small projects to
create typical Clinical Programming (CP) outputs using other (open source) languages.

See www.lucasprogramming.co.uk for creation of outputs in Python and Julia.

Here, the aim is to create the same outputs in Go and publish to the web in the same way.
